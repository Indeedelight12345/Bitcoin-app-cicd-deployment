       This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the
       content staged for the next commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a
       whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content with only part of the changes made
       to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore.

       The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is
       taken as the contents of the next commit. Thus after making any changes to the working tree, and
       before running the commit command, you must use the aadddd command to add any new or modified files to
       the index.

       This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of the
       specified file(s) at the time the add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the
       next commit, then you must run ggiitt aadddd again to add the new content to the index.

       The ggiitt ssttaattuuss command can be used to obtain a summary of which files have changes that are staged
       for the next commit.

       The ggiitt aadddd command will not add ignored files by default. If any ignored files were explicitly
       specified on the command line, ggiitt aadddd will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored files reached
       by directory recursion or filename globbing performed by Git (quote your globs before the shell)
       will be silently ignored. The _g_i_t _a_d_d command can be used to add ignored files with the --ff (force)
       option.

       Please see ggiitt--ccoommmmiitt(1) for alternative ways to add content to a commit.

       <pathspec>...
           Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g.  **..cc) can be given to add all matching files. Also a
           leading directory name (e.g.  ddiirr to add ddiirr//ffiillee11 and ddiirr//ffiillee22) can be given to update the
           index to match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g. specifying ddiirr will record
           not just a file ddiirr//ffiillee11 modified in the working tree, a file ddiirr//ffiillee22 added to the working
           tree, but also a file ddiirr//ffiillee33 removed from the working tree). Note that older versions of Git
           used to ignore removed files; use ----nnoo--aallll option if you want to add modified or new files but
           ignore removed ones.

           For more details about the <pathspec> syntax, see the _p_a_t_h_s_p_e_c entry in ggiittgglloossssaarryy(7).

       -n, --dry-run
           Don’t actually add the file(s), just show if they exist and/or will be ignored.

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

       -f, --force
           Allow adding otherwise ignored files.

       -i, --interactive
           Add modified contents in the working tree interactively to the index. Optional path arguments
           may be supplied to limit operation to a subset of the working tree. See “Interactive mode” for
           details.

       -p, --patch
           Interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and the work tree and add them to the
           index. This gives the user a chance to review the difference before adding modified contents to
           the index.

           This effectively runs aadddd ----iinntteerraaccttiivvee, but bypasses the initial command menu and directly
           jumps to the ppaattcchh subcommand. See “Interactive mode” for details.

       -e, --edit
           Open the diff vs. the index in an editor and let the user edit it. After the editor was closed,
           adjust the hunk headers and apply the patch to the index.

           The intent of this option is to pick and choose lines of the patch to apply, or even to modify
           the contents of lines to be staged. This can be quicker and more flexible than using the
           interactive hunk selector. However, it is easy to confuse oneself and create a patch that does
           not apply to the index. See EDITING PATCHES below.

       -u, --update
           Update the index just where it already has an entry matching <pathspec>. This removes as well as
           modifies index entries to match the working tree, but adds no new files.

           If no <pathspec> is given when --uu option is used, all tracked files in the entire working tree
           are updated (old versions of Git used to limit the update to the current directory and its
           subdirectories).

       -A, --all, --no-ignore-removal
           Update the index not only where the working tree has a file matching <pathspec> but also where
           the index already has an entry. This adds, modifies, and removes index entries to match the
           working tree.

           If no <pathspec> is given when --AA option is used, all files in the entire working tree are
           updated (old versions of Git used to limit the update to the current directory and its
           subdirectories).

       --no-all, --ignore-removal
           Update the index by adding new files that are unknown to the index and files modified in the
           working tree, but ignore files that have been removed from the working tree. This option is a
           no-op when no <pathspec> is used.

           This option is primarily to help users who are used to older versions of Git, whose "git add
           <pathspec>..." was a synonym for "git add --no-all <pathspec>...", i.e. ignored removed files.

       -N, --intent-to-add
           Record only the fact that the path will be added later. An entry for the path is placed in the
           index with no content. This is useful for, among other things, showing the unstaged content of
           such files with ggiitt ddiiffff and committing them with ggiitt ccoommmmiitt --aa.

       --refresh
           Don’t add the file(s), but only refresh their stat() information in the index.

       --ignore-errors
           If some files could not be added because of errors indexing them, do not abort the operation,
           but continue adding the others. The command shall still exit with non-zero status. The
           configuration variable aadddd..iiggnnoorreeEErrrroorrss can be set to true to make this the default behaviour.

       --ignore-missing
           This option can only be used together with --dry-run. By using this option the user can check if
           any of the given files would be ignored, no matter if they are already present in the work tree
           or not.

       --no-warn-embedded-repo
           By default, ggiitt aadddd will warn when adding an embedded repository to the index without using ggiitt
           ssuubbmmoodduullee aadddd to create an entry in ..ggiittmmoodduulleess. This option will suppress the warning (e.g., if
           you are manually performing operations on submodules).

       --renormalize
           Apply the "clean" process freshly to all tracked files to forcibly add them again to the index.
           This is useful after changing ccoorree..aauuttooccrrllff configuration or the tteexxtt attribute in order to
           correct files adde
